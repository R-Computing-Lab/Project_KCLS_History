The purpose of this paper is threefold. 1) We wanted to demonstrate that many of the popular personality measures from the beginning of the last century do map into the Big Five \citep{Goldberg1990}, 2) We wanted to provide a detailed profile of the  Kelly/Connolly Marriage Study on Personality and Aging (KCLS; \citealp{Kelly1987}) cohort, and 3) We wanted to tell the story of how the KCLS came to be. We hope that this fusion of history and measurement will encourage other researchers to look back thru the history of our field and rediscover other studies that still have more to tell us about our field. A handful of other researchers have done just that including Deary and colleague's (\citeyear{deary2011cohort}) work with the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947 \citep{TheScottishCouncilforResearchinEducation1933,TheScottishCouncilforResearchinEducation1949}, as well as Friedman and Martin's (\citeyear{friedman2011longevity}) work with the Genetic Studies of Genius \citep{terman1925genetic}, rebranded as the Terman Study of the Gifted. However, there are still many more longitudinal studies sitting in universities, libraries, and basements, waiting to be recovered.
