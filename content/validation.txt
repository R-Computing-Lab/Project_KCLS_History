\subsubsection{Personality} Self-, partner-, and peer-reports of personality were obtained using the 36-item Kelly Personality Rating Scale (PRS; \citealp{kelly194036}). The Kelly PRS uses a 25-point scale that was anchored with an adjective or phrase at each extreme and with the phrase ``most people'' at the scale's midpoint. The Kelly PRS has been successfully used in previous studies \citep{conley1985longitudinal,Jackson2015,Kelly1987}. 

A study was conducted to validate the Kelly PRS using more modern personality measures (See \citealp{Jackson2015} for additional details and analyses). The Kelly PRS along with the BFI \citep{john1999big}, the IPQ \citep{donnellan2005criterion} and the Mini IPIP \citep{Donnellan2006} were assessed. Big Five equivalent factors were created for the PRS measure by first using PRS items to predict composite Big Five factor scales from the three modern measures. Items related to the Big Five were retained and then a factor analysis was conducted. The resulting five-factor solution reflected the Big Five factor structure. Extraversion was assessed with 5-items (e.g., quiet, popular), agreeableness 6-items (e.g., courteous, sincere), conscientiousness 5 items (e.g., persistent, reliable), emotional stability 4-items (e.g., nervous, temperamental) and openness 4 items (e.g., cultured, intelligent). Multiple Rs for each of the Big Five composites indicate that the PRS adequately captures variation in the Big Five (avg $= .72$, min $= .62$, max $= .88$). 

The items were then used to create latent factors to be used in the prediction of mortality. For peer-reported personality, a hierarchical CFA was performed in which a latent factor was created for each of the five raters, and then a superordinate latent factor was created from the five latent peer factors. For the self-reports, each item served as an indicator. All 10 models fit the data well (CFIs $> .95$, RMSEAs $< .10$).
