(2011). Progressive taxation and the subjective well--being of nations. \\textit{Psychological science}, 0956797611420882.\n\\begin{itemize}\\item \\textit{Provide a detailed summary of the article:}\\\\\nThe authors examined the relationship between progressive taxation and levels of well--being. Specifically, the authors wanted to know whether there was a positive association, as this is what Rawl's theory of justice suggests.\n\\begin{itemize}\\item\\textit{(in terms of background},\n\nRawls -- a philosopher -- argues that a ``good society'' redistributes wealth in such a way that all of its members are equally likely to be successful -- at least with respect to public goods. Not much that can be done about genetic influences of success -- but that's a story for another time.\n\nProgressive taxation is a tax system where the wealthier pay a higher percentage of their income than the less wealthy. The authors' believe that Rawls would believe that this policy is more just. \n\\item \\textit{hypotheses}, \\\\ Therefore, societies with a more progressive taxation system would have members with high levels of well-being.\n\n\\item \\textit{methods},\\\\\nThey used Gallup poll survey data, where 59,634 individuals were nested within 54 nations. Subjects were surveyed on three batteries that the authors used for well-being: Cantrilâ€™s (1965) Self-Anchoring Striving Scale --  11 point likert--like scale, positivity of daily experiences was assessed by taking the mean of all answers that the authors deemed relevant, and negativity of daily experiences by the same method as positivity. The positivity and negativity items were binary, which makes me wonder why Item Response Theory was not used.\n\\item \\textit{results},\\\\\nThe authors broke the results into nation-level and multi-level analysis. While this helps with interpretation, I wonder as to why the authors broke up the analyses like this. I suspect that the authors may have only done the Nation Level analyses in the first submission of this paper. However, I cannot verify this suspicion beyond speculation. \n\nAnyway, the authors conducted three analyses within this paper.:\\begin{itemize}\\item Nation--Level\\begin{enumerate}\\item Correlation between Degree of Progressive Taxation and Global-Life Evaluation ratings. \\\\ They found a positive relationship at the Nation Level. \n\\item Mediation Analyses\\\\\nThe authors ran mediations on the level two means. $:($ They found that the relationship between progressive taxation and Global Life Evaluation was fully mediated by Satisfaction with Public Goods. However, the authors interpreted this at the individual level, not at the aggregate level. They assumed that individual citizens were more satisfied, not just the amalgam citizen (mean citizen). Their interpretation is over reaching without the use of MLM.\\\\\n``That is, citizens of nations with more--progressive taxation were on average more satisfied with their lives, had more positive daily experiences, and had fewer negative daily experiences than citizens of nations with less-progressive taxation.'' (page 89)\\end{enumerate}\\pagebreak\n\\item Multilevel\\\\ They did some multi-level analyses, but they really should have done it for all of their analyses. \n\\begin{enumerate}\\item[3.] They examined the following model (and did not include the estimates in their path diagram (which I suspect was made in powerpoint).) However, they ran the model three times -- once for each measure. For each model, they found that the mediation relationship held just as they had found in the aggregated model. However, it seems that the association between Well-Being and GDP is mediated thru two elements -- individual income and satisfaction with public goods. They would not have found this result had they stuck with their single level model.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[\\linewidth]{1}\\\\\nAnyway, they found \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textit{discussion, etc.)}. \\end{itemize}\\item \\textit{Emphasize details relevant to the} \\begin{itemize}\\item \\textit{data structure},\\\\\n59,634 individuals were nested within 54 nations\n\\item \\textit{method of analysis}, and \nSingle Level Path Analysis; and then Multilevel Mediation Analysis.\n\\item \\textit{statistical results}.\\end{itemize}\n\\chead{}\\textit{Please address as many of the following questions as you can}:\n\\item \\textit{Was multilevel modeling an appropriate choice for testing the authors' hypotheses?}\\\\\nYep -- but they didn't check for DIF. $:($   They needed a measurement model. They really just did a multilevel path analysis.\n\\item \\textit{What was the structure of their data set?}\\\\\nThey had individuals nested within nations.\n\\item \\textit{Did the authors conduct their multilevel analysis appropriately?} \\\\ NOPE\n\\begin{itemize}\\item \\textit{Look for (and comment on) the authors' model-building strategy},\\\\\nDidn't have one beyond theory. The authors did not include a supplemental -- so we don't really know if they did. CORRECTION: They did run tests with GDP adjusted for pruschasing power, but these analyses are not reported beyond a correlation between GDP and Adjusted GDP.\n\\item \\textit{whether or not they probed interactions},\\\\\nNope, but they did look into curvilinear effects (see note 4).\\item \\textit{reported ICC}, \nNope\n\\item \\textit{etc}. \\item \\textit{Be as comprehensive as possible, bringing in material from topics we have covered in class}.\\end{itemize}\n\\item \\textit{What software did they choose, and why?}\\\\\nMplus (4.21). I suspect they chose it because there was syntax, and they clearly already owned the software -- given that the version is very dated. However, it also looks like they created their scatter plots in excel.\n\\item \\textit{Did they use any of the specialized methods we discussed in class (\\eg, probing interactions, three-level models, alternative error structures, power analysis...)?}\\\\\nDoes path analysis count?\n\\item \\textit{Did they use any specialized methods (analyses, coding schemes) we did not discuss? Describe these methods and contrast them to similar methods we used in class.}\\\\\nNope. They used ``multilevel mediation analysis (Preacher, Zyphur, & Zhang, 2010).''\n\\item \\textit{Did the authors not use any specialized methods that they could have used profitably?}\\\\\nIRT. They averaged the items. Odds are that cross cultural work like this has serious issues with differential item functioning. Moreover, they ran the model three times -- once for each outcome. Instead, they ought to have done one of two things. \\begin{enumerate}\\item Used a Multivariate MLM Model, where all three outcomes were modeled simulatenously.\\item Used an IRT MLM model where the outcomes were used to estiamte a latent measure of subjective well-being.\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{itemize}\n\\pagebreak\\setboolean{@twoside}{false}\n\\includepdf[pages=-, ]{article.pdf}\n\n\n\\end{document}\n",
